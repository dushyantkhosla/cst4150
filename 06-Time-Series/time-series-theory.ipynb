    "\n",
    "At a high level, forecasting should seem like a regression problem - we are, after all, trying to predict a *quantity*. In typical regression problems, we try to predict $y$ using some linear combination of features in $X$. Linear models make certain assumptions about the underlying data. \n",

    "\n",
    "In typical forecasting problems, the most important $X$s are just **lagged values** of $y$.  This should be fairly intuitive; all we're saying is that *past values predict future values.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will differentiate forecasting into two paths\n",

    "- _Time Series only_\n",
    "  - we have historical values and we would like to predict future values\n",
    "- _Time Series and Exogenous Variables_\n",
    "  - in addition to historical data, we have external variables that might affect $y$\n",
    "  - for example, store sales might be affected not only by past values, but also weather, disposable income of zipcode, holiday effects etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, running a regression on $y$ (our time-series) using its lagged values suffers from more than a few problems, notably\n",
    "\n",
    "- **autocorrelation,** \n",
    "- **non-stationarity** and \n",
    "- **seasonality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals ($actual - predicted$) of a regression analysis are supposed to be white noise, or in statistical terms, they should follow the Standard Normal Distribution (bell-curve, $\\mu=0$ and $ \\sigma=1$). With time-series data, we observe that residuals exhibit clear patterns; the $e_i$ are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Autocorrelation Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pandas` has a function called `autocorrelation_plot()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting models like `ARIMA` take advantage of this fact by incorporating this information into the model: if $+ve$ residual at $t_0$ means the residual at $t_1$ will be $+ve$ as well, these models will lower the forecasted value for $t_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "A time-series is said to be stationary if its **statistical properties** such as *mean* and *variance* remain **constant over time**. Formally, for stationarity, the data must obey the following assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mu \\neq f(t)$, the mean shouldn't change over time\n",
    "- $\\sigma \\neq f(t)$, the variance shouldn't change over time\n",
    "- $cov(i, i+m) \\neq f(t)$, the covariance should be constant over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, if $y$ exhibits stable behaviour over time then it is probable that it will follow the same in the future. _This is critical because time-series models like ARIMA do not operate on non-stationary data._ **Trend** and **Seasonality** are the **main causes of non-stationarity**. The central idea behind time series models is therefore to\n",
    "\n",
    "-  to <u>estimate the trend and seasonality</u> in the series\n",
    "-  <u>remove these from the series</u> to get a stationary series.\n",
    "-  implement statistical <u>forecasting</u> techniques on this series.\n",
    "-  convert the forecasted values into the original scale by <u>applying trend and seasonality constraints back</u>.\n",

    "### a. Differencing to find $d$\n",
    "\n",
    " The first (and most important) step in fitting an ARIMA model is the determination of the *order of differencing needed to stationarize the series.* Differencing tends to introduce negative correlation: if the series initially shows strong positive autocorrelation, then a non-seasonal difference will reduce the autocorrelation and perhaps even drive the lag-1 autocorrelation to a negative value. If you apply a second nonseasonal difference (which is occasionally necessary), the lag-1 autocorrelation will be driven even further in the negative direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the lag-1 autocorrelation is zero or even negative, then the series does *not* need further differencing. Normally, the correct $d$ is the lowest order of differencing that yields a time series which\n",

    "| The optimal order of differencing is often the order of differencing at which the standard deviation is lowest. |\n",
    "| A model with no orders of differencing assumes that the original series is stationary (mean-reverting). A model with one order of differencing assumes that the original series has a constant average trend (e.g. a random walk or SES-type model, with or without growth).
